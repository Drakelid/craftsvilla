# Craftsvilla

CRAFTSVILLA is an engaging and visually appealing website designed to promote creativity, bonding, and relaxation for individuals of all ages. As a front-end development project, our goal is to design a user-friendly platform using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript, with design support from Figma.

This website aims to provide a space where people can come together to participate in creative activities and workshops. Our target audience includes parents and children, friends, colleagues, and essentially anyone looking to spend quality time together through art.
